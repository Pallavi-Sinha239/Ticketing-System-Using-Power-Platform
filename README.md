# Ticketing-System-Using-Power-Platform
A canvas app for Customer Service Representatives to keep track of tickets created by customers and to increase their efficiency by resolving them in less time.

We have created a canvas app where a company's CSR's can login and see the status of tickets created by customers. If unable to login, then they can create a ticket for the login issue. After login, they can see the assigned tickets in their dashboard and start resolving them. They can contact customer using phone or email and can manually update the status of tickets.

Tools Used:
1. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Marketing
2. Power Platform

Features:
1. Easy to login with Canvas app UI.
2. Password Protection for every CSR.
3. If any CSR is unable to login, can create a separate ticket which will directly go to admins.
4. Creates and updates the ticket status of customers in the app and the dataverse table.

5. Ticket status will shown in main dashboard.
6. CSR can call or email the customers and manually update the satus of tickets.
